This code currently does not work because we have not figured out how to implement our OCR code, so we are assuming it works for the Proof.
It implements the use of If/Else, Variables, Functions, Classes, Booleanse, While Loops, and File Manipulation. We did not feel the need to implement Lists or For loops because we are not deep enough in our progress to implement them.

Please take a good look at the comments to understand how the program wouldve been meant to work
