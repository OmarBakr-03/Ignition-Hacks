Purpose: This code is essentially for people who need to go afk in meets. It looks at the captions of the meet and uses OCR to figure out if your name is being said. If your name is said it will send a notif or call your phone telling you to come back. We are still unsure. It will also have the feature to trancript your lectures and record the audio while uploading it to the cloud.

This code currently does not work because we have not figured out how to implement our OCR code, so we are assuming it works for the Proof.
It implements the use of If/Else, Variables, Functions, Classes, Booleanse, While Loops, and File Manipulation. We did not feel the need to implement Lists or For loops because we are not deep enough in our progress to implement them.

Please take a good look at the comments to understand how the program wouldve been meant to work
